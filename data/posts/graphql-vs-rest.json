Let's objectively compare both approaches.\n\n## REST Overview\n\nRepresentational State Transfer:\n\n- Resource-based URLs\n- HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)\n- Stateless\n- Well-understood and widely adopted\n\n## GraphQL Overview\n\nQuery language for APIs:\n\n- Single endpoint\n- Client specifies exactly what data it needs\n- Strongly typed schema\n- Real-time with subscriptions\n\n## When to Use REST\n\n- Simple CRUD applications\n- Public APIs with many consumers\n- When caching is critical\n- Team familiar with REST\n\n## When to Use GraphQL\n\n- Complex data requirements\n- Mobile apps with bandwidth constraints\n- Rapid frontend iteration\n- Multiple clients with different needs\n\n## Hybrid Approach\n\nMany teams use both:\n\n- REST for simple operations\n- GraphQL for complex queries\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere's no universal winner. Choose based on your specific requirements."

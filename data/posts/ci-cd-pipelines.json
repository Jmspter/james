Let's build robust pipelines that you can trust.\n\n## Continuous Integration\n\nAutomate testing on every commit:\n\n```yaml\nname: CI\non: [push, pull_request]\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n      - run: npm ci\n      - run: npm test\n```\n\n## Continuous Deployment\n\nAutomate deployments after successful tests:\n\n- **Staging** - Deploy on every merge to main\n- **Production** - Deploy on tags or manual approval\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Fast feedback** - Fail fast, notify immediately\n2. **Reproducible builds** - Same input, same output\n3. **Security scanning** - SAST, DAST, dependency checks\n4. **Environment parity** - Dev, staging, prod should be similar\n\n## Pipeline Stages\n\n1. Build\n2. Unit tests\n3. Integration tests\n4. Security scan\n5. Deploy to staging\n6. E2E tests\n7. Deploy to production\n\n## Conclusion\n\nInvest in your CI/CD pipeline. It pays dividends in reliability and developer productivity."
